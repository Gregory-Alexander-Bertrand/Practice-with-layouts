# Practice-with-layouts
I made this so I could practice my flex layouts while having a lot of different elements on screen.
I also used a different styling in my navbar than I usually do.
Instead of veritical dropdown menus on hover, the links in the dropdown display in line.
For the actual man content, I have three divs which I have displayed as flex.
Each div is going to contain vertical contents.
